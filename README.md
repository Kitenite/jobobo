# Description:

A webapp for automating your job application process. Very much a work in progress.

## How to use

Not meant to be ran outside of my environment. You'll have to use your own firebase credentials.

- [Landing page](https://jobs.madebykiet.com/)
- [Design doc](https://www.figma.com/file/2SIR35uhr3axARhBKnRFpq/Jobobo?node-id=0%3A1)

But if you really want to, you can run it with typical node.js commands:

```
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
```

## Made with

`vite` + `react` + `typescript` + `tailwindcss` + `firebase`
